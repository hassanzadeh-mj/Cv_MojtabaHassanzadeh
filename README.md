# Personal Website Project      ![enter image description here](https://s8.uupload.ir/files/new_project_%281%29_7vkw.png)
Welcome to my personal website project! This website is created to showcase and present my professional resume and profile. It serves as a hub for businesses, employers, and individuals interested in collaborating with me to learn more about my skills and experiences.

**Technologies Used:**

1.  **Next.js:** I utilized Next.js to optimize page loading speed and enhance the user experience. The implementation of Server-Side Rendering (SSR) ensures that selected sections of the site display dynamic and up-to-date information from my resume and profile.
    
2.  **Jest:** For quality assurance, I employed Jest to write and execute unit tests. These tests verify the accuracy and efficiency of components and JavaScript files on the website. Additionally, snapshot tests ensure visual stability and proper functionality across various components.
    
3.  **Ant Design:** To create an aesthetically pleasing and professional design, I integrated Ant Design. It provided ready-made components and beautiful visuals, expediting the page design process. Moreover, I customized Ant Design components and themes to align with the site's unique design needs and color schemes.
    

By leveraging these technologies and tools, my personal website project achieves its main objective - presenting a comprehensive and attractive resume that highlights my skills, experiences, and knowledge. Visitors can easily access information about me and establish initial connections. Thank you for visiting my website!
